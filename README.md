# IoT_Intruder_Detection
This repository contains an Arduino-based intruder detection system that integrates RFID authentication, motion detection, and an LCD display. The system ensures secured access by authenticating users with an RFID card. If unauthorized motion is detected, the system raises an alarm. Additionally, the LCD provides real-time status updates.
